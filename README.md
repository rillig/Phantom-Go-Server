This is the server-side part of the Android Phantom Go app.

It is a testbed for Kotlin, Spring, JPA, Hibernate, and many more
technologies.

As of November 2017, the app is still single-player,
therefore the code in this project is not heavily tested.
It is rather intended as a best-practice project for writing
_correct_ code and trying out new ideas.
